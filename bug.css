The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can produce unexpected results if the order of operations is not considered carefully or if there are issues with unit compatibility. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected but `width: calc(100% - 20%);` might not. The unexpected outcome is that the percentage is not relative to the parent container. In other scenarios, missing spaces around the operators can lead to parsing errors. For example `width:calc(100%-20px);` will be invalid.
